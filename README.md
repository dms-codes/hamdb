# Ham Radio Callsign Information Retrieval

This Python script allows you to retrieve information about ham radio callsigns using the [HamDB API](http://api.hamdb.org/v1). You can obtain details such as callsign class, grid location, latitude, longitude, name, and address.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary library:

   ```python
   import requests
   ```

2. Define the base URL for the HamDB API:

   ```python
   urlbase = "http://api.hamdb.org/v1/{}/json/hamdb"
   ```

3. Implement functions to retrieve specific information about a callsign:

   - `GetData(callsign)`: Retrieves all available data for the specified callsign.
   - `GetClass(callsign)`: Retrieves the class of the callsign.
   - `GetGrid(callsign)`: Retrieves the grid location of the callsign.
   - `GetLatLong(callsign)`: Retrieves the latitude and longitude of the callsign.
   - `GetName(callsign)`: Retrieves the name associated with the callsign.
   - `GetFullAddress(callsign)`: Retrieves the full address information of the callsign.

   For example, to get the name associated with a callsign:

   ```python
   name = GetName("vk3ye")
   print(name)
   ```

4. Customize the functions or use them as needed to retrieve specific information about ham radio callsigns.

## Example

In this example, we retrieve the name associated with the "vk3ye" callsign and print it.
